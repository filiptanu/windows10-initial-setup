# Windows 10 Initial Setup

This repo contains scripts to setup my PC after a clean install of Windows 10.

## Set the `Unrestricted` Execution Policy

In order to be able to execute the scripts in the repository, you need to have the `Unrestricted` execution policy set in PowerShell. The easiest way to do it is to set an execution policy for a new PowerShell session, this will not change any system wide execution policies. Open the Command Prompt as an Administrator and execute the following:

```
%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

Now you can run any of the `.ps1` scripts in the current PowerShell window.

See the [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.2) for details about the execution policies.

## Remove Default Windows 10 Apps

To remove the default Windows 10 apps run:

```
.\scripts\remove-default-windows-apps.ps1
```

You can see the full list of installed apps by running:

```
Get-AppxPackage â€“AllUsers | Select Name, PackageFullName
```

You can update the `remove-default-windows-apps.ps1` script with any items from the resulting list.
